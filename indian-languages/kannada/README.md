The document confirms the changes that were proposed by BCI in 2022. These were outlined in document [Kannada Braille Symbols.jpg](../recommended-changes-2022/Kannada%20Braille%20Symbols.jpg) (image file so not accessible).

Please note there is a minor error in row SI.No. 30 of the table in this document which concerns unicode character 0C98. The Braille dot numbers shown are correct, 126, but the symbol given in the next column shows dots 136 which is incorrect.
