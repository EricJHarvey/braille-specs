Israel has a unified braille code that supports texts in Hebrew,
Arabic and English (3 of the 4 most used languages in Isreal, beside
Russian).

The following spread sheet presumably is the result of a meeting held
in 2016 where the different braille authorities came together and
decided on this unified code.
